                    In Apex Legends, players in squads of two or three select a character with pre-set abilities, referred to as a Legend, and battle against other players 
                    to be the last squad standing. Players earn experience based on their performance in matches, through which they can earn Apex Packs that contain cosmetic 
                    items. Cosmetics can also be purchased from the in-game store, earned through seasonal Battle Passes, or awarded through limited-time events.

                    Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is an online tactical shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released worldwide 
                    for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on December 1, 2015; the game was also released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S exactly five years
                    later on December 1, 2020. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player assumes control of an 
                    attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage, defusing a bomb, and taking control of an objective within a room. The title 
                    has no campaign but features a series of short, offline missions called, "situations" that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing
                     on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the "White Masks", a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.
